# Release Guide

We ship fast and often.

We plan what new features we want to release in any given week, but we do not batch up features into one weekly release. Generally speaking, as soon as an individual feature is completed and merged into `main`, it should be released. Likewise, as soon as a bug is fixed, the fix should be released. On occasion, we may batch up multiple features that are expected to land the same day, but this happens on `main`, there is no release branch involved. In this case, we simply do not cut a new release until all the expected features land.

This allows us to avoid having to maintain release branches while ensuring that users are always able to use the latest features of the CDP SDK.

## Publishing

This section contains step-by-step instructions for publishing new versions of the CDP SDK.

> [!TIP]
> When publishing a feature that has landed in both languages, you should release each one individually. Do not create one PR that contains the bump for both languages. This will make it easier to tag each package individually. You should follow the instructions for one language to completion, then move on to the next other language.

### TypeScript

#### First time setup

For PR linking and author attribution, you'll need a GitHub Personal Access Token.

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and create a GitHub PAT with `read:user` and `repo:status` scopes. This is for author attribution
2. Export your token in your shell (`export GITHUB_TOKEN={YOUR_TOKEN}`), and optionally save it to your shell profile (`echo "\nexport GITHUB_TOKEN={YOUR_TOKEN}" >> ~/.zshrc`)

#### Publishing

Follow these steps to publish a new version of the TypeScript CDP SDK.

1. Ensure you are on the `main` branch and have the latest changes
1. Create a new branch for your changes, e.g. `bump/ts`. The branch name doesn't matter, and you will delete this branch after the release
1. From the `typescript` folder, run `pnpm changeset:version` to automatically bump the version and create a new changelog. Make note of the new version, as this will be used in subsequent steps
1. Manually update `src/version.ts` with the new version
1. Add and commit the changes with the message: `chore: bump @coinbase/cdp-sdk to {NEW_VERSION}`
1. Push your branch, create a PR and get an approval
1. Once approved, merge your PR
1. Once merged, manually trigger the [Publish @coinbase/cdp-sdk](https://github.com/coinbase/cdp-sdk/actions/workflows/typescript_publish.yml) workflow
1. Once the workflow has completed, go back to the `main` branch and pull the latest changes
1. Tag the new version with `git tag -s @coinbase/cdp-sdk@v{NEW_VERSION} -m "Release @coinbase/cdp-sdk {NEW_VERSION}"`
1. Push the tag with `git push origin @coinbase/cdp-sdk@v{NEW_VERSION}`
1. Delete your release branch
1. Trigger the [Deploy CDP SDK documentation to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/coinbase/cdp-sdk/actions/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml) action. Select `typescript` as the language to deploy

### Python

Follow these steps to publish a new version of the Python CDP SDK.

1. Ensure you are on the `main` branch and have the latest changes
1. Create a new branch for your changes, e.g. `bump/py`. The branch name doesn't matter, and you will delete this branch after the release
1. Calculate the new version by looking at the files in the `changelog.d` folder:
   - If there is a file ending in `removal.md`, this is a **major** version bump
   - If there is a file ending in `feature.md`, this is a **minor** version bump
   - If there is a file ending in `bugfix.md`, this is a **patch** version bump
   - For example, if the current version is `1.0.0` and there is both a `123.feature.md` and `456.bugfix.md`, the new version will be `1.1.0`
1. Update the version number in the following files in the `python/` folder with the new version:
   - `pyproject.toml`
   - `cdp/__version__.py`
   - `docs/conf.py`
1. Run `uv run towncrier build --yes --version={NEW_VERSION}` to update the changelog
1. Add and commit all the changes with the message: `chore: bump cdp-sdk to {NEW_VERSION}`
1. Push your branch, create a PR and get an approval
1. Once approved, merge your PR
1. Once merged, manually trigger the [Publish cdp-sdk](https://github.com/coinbase/cdp-sdk/actions/workflows/python_publish.yml) workflow
1. Once the workflow has completed, go back to the `main` branch and pull the latest changes
1. Tag the new version with `git tag -s cdp-sdk@v{NEW_VERSION} -m "Release cdp-sdk {NEW_VERSION}"`
1. Push the tag with `git push origin cdp-sdk@v{NEW_VERSION}`
1. Delete your release branch
1. Trigger the [Deploy CDP SDK documentation to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/coinbase/cdp-sdk/actions/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml) action. Select `python` as the language to deploy

### Rust

Follow these steps to publish a new version of the Rust CDP SDK.

1. Ensure you are on the `main` branch and have the latest changes
1. Create a new branch for your changes, e.g. `bump/rust`. The branch name doesn't matter, and you will delete this branch after the release
1. Calculate the new version by looking at the files in the `rust/changelog.d` folder:
   - If there is a file ending in `removal.md`, this is a **major** version bump
   - If there is a file ending in `feature.md`, this is a **minor** version bump
   - If there is a file ending in `bugfix.md`, this is a **patch** version bump
   - For example, if the current version is `1.0.0` and there is both a `123.feature.md` and `456.bugfix.md`, the new version will be `1.1.0`
1. Update the version number in `rust/Cargo.toml`
1. From the `rust` folder, run `git cliff --unreleased --tag v{NEW_VERSION} --prepend CHANGELOG.md` to update the changelog
1. Remove all files from `rust/changelog.d/` except `.gitignore`
1. Add and commit all the changes with the message: `chore(rust): bump cdp-sdk to {NEW_VERSION}`
1. Push your branch, create a PR and get an approval
1. Once approved, merge your PR
1. Once merged, manually trigger the [Publish cdp-sdk (Rust)](https://github.com/coinbase/cdp-sdk/actions/workflows/rust_publish.yml) workflow
1. Once the workflow has completed, go back to the `main` branch and pull the latest changes

1. Delete your release branch

### Java
